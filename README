# Project Name: SteamClone

## 1. Project Overview
SteamClone is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionality and user experience of the world’s leading digital game distribution platform, Steam. The project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of modern web development practices, focusing on high-load data management, secure e-commerce transactions, and a social-driven user interface.

The primary objective of this project is to build a scalable ecosystem where users can discover, purchase, and manage a digital library of games, while administrators have the tools to manage the global catalog and user base. built using **Node.js/Express** and **MongoDB**. The primary goal of this application is to provide an intuitive interface for browsing games with advanced filtering (by genre, price, or tags) and a responsive "featured" carousel

Key features:
Secure Transactions: Implementation of a shopping cart system and integrated payment gateways (e.g., PayPal/Stripe) to simulate real-world game purchases.

User Personalization: Creation of persistent user profiles, including a personalized library, "Wishlist" functionality, and purchase history.

Performance & Scalability: Utilization of MongoDB for flexible data modeling of complex game metadata and Redis for caching frequently accessed store pages to optimize load times.

Content Management: A dedicated administrative dashboard to add new titles, manage media assets (trailers/screenshots), and monitor system-wide sales.

## 2. System Architecture
The system follows a standard **Client-Server architecture**.

* **Frontend:** HTML,CSS,JS
* **Backend:** RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.
